# Stock Market Dashboard

## Overview
This Stock Market Dashboard is a user-friendly web application designed to provide insightful analysis of stock market data. It's built using Streamlit, a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications. This dashboard allows users to visualize stock data for several major companies, including Amazon, Google, Meta (formerly Facebook), Netflix, Starbucks, and Tesla.

## Data Source Credits
The stock data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the following datasets:
- [Meta Platforms Inc. (META)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/meta-platforms-inc-meta)
- [Tesla Stock Price (TSLA)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/tesla-stock-price)
- [Starbucks Stock Price (SBUX)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/starbucks-stock-price)
- [Netflix Stock Price (NFLX)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/netflix-stock-price)
- [Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/amazon-com-inc-amzn)
- [Google Stock Price (GOOG)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/google-stock-price)

The images used in the dashboard are also sourced from these Kaggle datasets.

## Installation and Running the Application
To get started with this dashboard, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Python
If you donâ€™t have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
